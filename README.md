## Introduction
Hi there, this is a simple tool that can automatically download/sync resources from Coventry University Moodle and organize them in a clear way for you.    
In a word, save you bunch of time!

## Download
#### Windows
[https://sourceforge.net/projects/covsyncer/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/covsyncer/)    

P.S. In most case it is self-contained, if you can not open it.    
Just install the runtime environment: [https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.1/python-3.5.1.exe](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.1/python-3.5.1.exe)  It is very small.
#### Mac
[https://sourceforge.net/projects/covsyncer/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/covsyncer/)    
    
P.S. You may change the System Preference - Security & Privacy - Allow apps downloaded from to ‘Anywhere’

## Notice
You only need to login once, after that this tool will remember the password for you.    
This tool will NOT collect any of your personal information.
